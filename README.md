Finding Insights into IMDB’s Top 100 Movies

## Project Description
This project focuses on scraping the data from the IMBD website’s top 100 movie list. The goal is to get data such as the title, ratings, genre, number of votes, list of actors and directors, gross revenue etc, and export it to a CSV file. This data will be further analyzed to find insights into the top 100 movies of all time. It will be interesting to see the common trends among movies that have extremely high ratings.
